Adding Hong Kong land department's map as the basemap in Folium
It was great to have an accurate online map of Hong Kong but it is kind of lack of documents to apply it to the Folium, Just a small example for anyone who is interested to do so. 
Feel free to know if you have any suggestion to this code.
